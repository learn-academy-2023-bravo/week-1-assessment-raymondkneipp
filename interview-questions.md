# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement controls the execution of code based on a condition. If a condition is true then one block of code will run. If the condition is false then an alternate code block can run.

Researched answer: A conditional statement is code that instructs the computer is perform a task provided that certain conditions are met. These statements allow programs to simulate human behavior by taking different actions based on the decision made.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a program developed by Linus Torvalds to solve a huge problem in software development known as version control. GitHub is a 'hub' for code. Using the git version control software, developers can upload their code to GitHub. Many people can make changes and add features to the code and git handles how each contribution is made.

Researched answer: Git allows you to keep track and manage your programs history. This is helpful because if a bug is introduced onto the code, you can revert those changes and go about a different way to find a solution. GitHub allows you to host and manage your git repositories. This makes it easy for many people to contribute to the same project.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: !, &&, ||

Researched answer: && (AND) returns true if and only if both values on either side of the operator are true. || (OR) will return true if one of two values are true. The bang operator (! NOT) will invert a value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index represents an items position in a collection. An index points to a given value.

Researched answer: An index is typically a number and is used as an address in an ordered collection. A value can be stored in an ordered collection at a given index.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: A string can only contain characters. Arrays can hold any data type. Methods like toUpperCase only exist on strings. Both arrays and strings can be indexed. arr[0] and str[0] are both valid. Both will return the first item in the array and the first letter in the string.

Researched answer: Arrays can store any data type while strings can only store ASCII characters. Both arrays and strings have length properties. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is put simply two developers working on one task. One person is the navigator. They are the 'back seat driver'. Then you have the driver. They are the one typing. The navigator guides the driver through the task.

Researched answer: Pair programming enables better communication between two developers. It facilitates learning as you can talk through problems and see different approaches to a given problem. The Driver is the person behind the computer typing. The Navigator guides the Driver, catches and errors, or suggests a better way to do something.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter and returns a function. An example of this is Array.prototype.map

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework to make sure everything works as intended.

3. Objects: An object is a collection of keys and values.

4. Method: Methods are a property that contains behavior.

5. Classes: Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
